## Implementation
## Implementation Plan: README Update for Sandbox PR Flow - ContextPilot

**Feature Request:** Small README update to test sandbox PR flow. Add 'Review Request' section.

**Context:** ContextPilot - AI-powered development platform with agents, Codespaces integration, and GitHub workflows.

**Goal:**  Clearly document the process for requesting reviews on sandbox PRs within the ContextPilot project, ensuring a smooth and efficient review process for contributors.

**1. File Structure & Location:**

*   We'll modify the main `README.md` file located at the root of the repository.  This ensures maximum visibility for contributors.

    ```
    ContextPilot/
    ├── .github/
    ├── src/
    ├── tests/
    ├── README.md  <-- Target file
    ├── ...
    ```

**2. Implementation Steps:**

1.  **Create a new branch:**  Start by creating a new branch for this update.  This follows standard Git workflow practices.

    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature/update-sandbox-pr-readme
    ```

2.  **Edit `README.md`:**  Open the `README.md` file in your editor and add the "Review Request" section.  Consider the existing structure and placement of other sections to maintain consistency.  I recommend placing it after a section describing the sandbox environment and before any advanced usage instructions.

3.  **Write the "Review Request" section:**  Craft clear and concise instructions on how to request a review for a sandbox PR.  This includes:

    *   **When to request a review:**  Specify the criteria for when a sandbox PR is ready for review (e.g., basic functionality implemented, tests passing, code style adhered to).
    *   **How to request a review:**  Explain the process using GitHub's built-in review request functionality.  Mention specific users or teams to request reviews from (if applicable).  Consider using a CODEOWNERS file for automated review assignments.
    *   **What to include in the PR description:**  Outline the information that should be included in the PR description to facilitate the review process (e.g., a summary of changes, testing instructions, relevant context).
    *   **Expected turnaround time:**  Provide an estimated timeframe for when a review can be expected.
    *   **Addressing feedback:**  Explain how to address feedback received during the review process.

4.  **Commit Changes:**  Commit the changes with a descriptive message.

    ```bash
    git add README.md
    git commit -m "feat: Add 'Review Request' section to README for sandbox PRs"
    ```

5.  **Push Branch:** Push the branch to your remote repository.

    ```bash
    git push origin feature/update-sandbox-pr-readme
    ```

6.  **Create Pull Request:**  Create a pull request from the `feature/update-sandbox-pr-readme` branch to the `main` branch.  Include a clear title and description summarizing the changes.

7.  **Request Review:**  Request a review from relevant team members.

8.  **Address Feedback:**  Address any feedback received during the review process and update the PR accordingly.

9.  **Merge Pull Request:**  Once the PR is approved, merge it into the `main` branch.

**3. Code Example (README.md Snippet):**

```markdown
## Sandbox Environment

This section describes the sandbox environment for testing ContextPilot changes.  It allows contributors to experiment with new features and bug fixes without affecting the main codebase.  [Link to more detailed sandbox documentation, if available]

## Review Request

Once you've made changes in the sandbox environment and are ready for feedback, follow these steps to request a review:

1.  **Ensure your PR is ready:** Before requesting a review, make sure your code:
    *   Implements the basic functionality you intended.
    *   Passes all relevant tests.
    *   Adheres to the project's code style guidelines (see [link to code style guide]).

2.  **Request a review on GitHub:** Use GitHub's built-in review request feature.  You can request a review from specific individuals or teams.  Consider adding `@contextpilot/core-team` for general reviews.  If the changes relate to a specific agent, consider adding the agent's maintainer.  (See `CODEOWNERS` file for recommended reviewers).

3.  **Provide a clear PR description:** In your pull request description, include the following information:
    *   A brief summary of the changes you've made.
    *   Instructions on how to test your changes in the sandbox environment.  Be specific!
    *   Any relevant context or background information that might be helpful for reviewers.  For example, link to the issue this PR addresses.

4.  **Expected Turnaround Time:** We aim to provide reviews within 2 business days.  If you haven't received a review within that timeframe, feel free to ping the reviewers.

5.  **Addressing Feedback:**  Reviewers may provide feedback on your code.  Address this feedback by making the necessary changes and pushing them to your branch.  Respond to each comment to indicate that you've addressed it or to explain why you've chosen not to.

**4. Best Practices and Patterns:**

*   **Clarity and Conciseness:**  Use clear and concise language to avoid ambiguity.
*   **Actionable Instructions:**  Provide specific, step-by-step instructions that contributors can easily follow.
*   **Links to Resources:**  Include links to relevant documentation, code style guides, and other resources.
*   **Consistency:**  Maintain consistency with the existing style and formatting of the `README.md` file.
*   **CODEOWNERS File:**  Utilize a `CODEOWNERS` file in the `.github/` directory to automatically assign reviewers based on file paths.  This ensures that the right people are notified of changes.  Example:

    ```
    # .github/CODEOWNERS

    # Core team reviews everything in the core directory
    /src/ @contextpilot/core-team

    # Specific agent maintainers
    /src/agents/my_agent/ @agent_maintainer
    ```

*   **Automated Checks:**  Consider adding automated checks (e.g., linters, formatters) to the CI/CD pipeline to ensure code quality and consistency.  This can help reduce the amount of manual review required.

**5. Actionable Items:**

*   [ ] Create a new branch: `feature/update-sandbox-pr-readme`
*   [ ] Edit `README.md` to add the "Review Request" section (see code example above).
*   [ ] Commit changes with message: "feat: Add 'Review Request' section to README for sandbox PRs"
*   [ ] Push branch to remote repository.
*   [ ] Create a pull request to the `main` branch.
*   [ ] Request review from relevant team members.
*   [ ] Address feedback and merge the PR.

**6. Considerations:**

*   **Target Audience:** Keep the target audience (contributors) in mind when writing the instructions.  Assume they have a basic understanding of Git and GitHub, but may not be familiar with the specific workflows of the ContextPilot project.
*   **Evolving Process:**  The review process may evolve over time.  Be prepared to update the `README.md` file as needed to reflect any changes.
*   **Sandbox Documentation:**  If a more detailed document exists describing the sandbox environment, link to it from the `README.md` file.

This detailed implementation plan provides a clear and actionable guide for updating the `README.md` file to document the sandbox PR review request process for the ContextPilot project.  By following these steps, we can ensure a smooth and efficient review process for contributors, leading to higher quality code and faster development cycles.
