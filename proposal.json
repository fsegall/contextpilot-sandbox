Consider reviewing their triggers.\n- üì¶ Context Agent: Query the knowledge base for past performance optimizations on similar APIs or dependencies; analyze current usage patterns and data volumes for contextual bottlenecks.\n- üìã Spec Agent: Review the current API's performance requirements and establish new, measurable response time targets; define clear validation criteria for any proposed improvements.\n\n## Proposed Changes\n\n### 1. Review event subscriptions for idle agents\n\n**Priority:** MEDIUM\n**Assigned to:** developer\n\n**Implementation:**\n- Update agent `__init__` to subscribe to new events\n- Add handler method for new event type\n- Test event flow with demo script\n\n\n## Benefits\n\nImplementing these changes will:\n- Improve agent coordination and collaboration\n- Reduce errors and edge cases\n- Enhance system reliability\n- Better developer experience\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. Review this proposal\n2. Approve to implement changes\n3. Test with existing workflows\n4.
