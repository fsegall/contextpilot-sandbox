Review error logs.\n- ⏸️ Idle agents: spec, development, context, coach, milestone. Consider reviewing their triggers.\n- 📋 Spec Agent: From a validation and requirements perspective, the core issue lies in code that **lacks explicit, enforced validation of incoming interaction messages and their conformance to defined communication protocols and data schemas**. Improve this by implementing rigorous **schema and protocol validation at every inbound message handler**, ensuring agents operate only on unambiguous, specified data to make informed decisions.\n\n## Proposed Changes\n\n### 1. Review error logs and fix agent error handling\n\n**Priority:** HIGH\n**Assigned to:** developer\n\n**Implementation:**\n- Review error logs in `.agent_state/` files\n- Add try-catch blocks around agent operations\n- Improve error reporting to event bus\n\n\n## Benefits\n\nImplementing these changes will:\n- Improve agent coordination and collaboration\n- Reduce errors and edge cases\n- Enhance system reliability\n- Better developer experience\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1.
