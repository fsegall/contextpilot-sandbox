', the following improvements were identified:\n\n- ‚ö†Ô∏è 1 errors occurred across all agents. Review error logs.\n- ‚è∏Ô∏è Idle agents: spec, development, context, coach, milestone. Consider reviewing their triggers.\n- üìã Spec Agent: As a Spec Agent, determining true improvement in agent interaction necessitates immediate validation against updated inter-agent communication specifications and performance benchmarks. Action: Develop and execute targeted test cases to confirm whether observed communication patterns consistently meet the new, desired interaction requirements.\n\n## Proposed Changes\n\n### 1. Review error logs and fix agent error handling\n\n**Priority:** HIGH\n**Assigned to:** developer\n\n**Implementation:**\n- Review error logs in `.agent_state/` files\n- Add try-catch blocks around agent operations\n- Improve error reporting to event bus\n\n### 2.
