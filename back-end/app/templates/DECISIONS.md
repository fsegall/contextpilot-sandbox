# üéØ {{project_name}} ‚Äî Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

> **Important technical decisions and their rationale**

---

## ADR-001: Use Google Pub/Sub for Event Bus

**Date:** 2025-10-14  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Accepted  
**Deciders:** @team

### Context
Need a reliable event bus for multi-agent communication. Considered Kafka, Redis Streams, and Pub/Sub.

### Decision
Use Google Cloud Pub/Sub as the event bus.

### Rationale
- ‚úÖ Zero operations (serverless)
- ‚úÖ Native integration with Cloud Run
- ‚úÖ 99.95% SLA
- ‚úÖ Auto-scaling
- ‚úÖ Cost-effective for our scale

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- No infrastructure to manage
- Seamless GCP integration
- Built-in monitoring
- Dead letter queues included

**Negative:**
- Vendor lock-in to GCP (mitigated by adapter pattern)
- 7-day max retention (acceptable for our use case)

**Neutral:**
- Learning curve for team

### Alternatives Considered
1. **Kafka**: Too complex for our scale
2. **Redis Streams**: Requires managing Redis cluster

## ADR-002: Adapter Pattern for Rewards

**Date:** 2025-10-13  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Accepted  
**Deciders:** @team

### Context
Need to support both off-chain (Firestore) and on-chain (Polygon) rewards during transition period.

### Decision
Implement Adapter Pattern with `RewardsAdapter` interface.

### Rationale
- ‚úÖ Pluggable backends (off-chain ‚Üî on-chain)
- ‚úÖ Testable (can mock blockchain)
- ‚úÖ Gradual migration path
- ‚úÖ No code changes in agents when switching

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Can develop with Firestore, deploy with blockchain
- Easy to test (no blockchain required)
- Business logic decoupled from infrastructure

**Negative:**
- Extra abstraction layer
- Slightly more code

## ADR-003: Change Proposals (No Auto-Modify)

**Date:** 2025-10-14  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Accepted  
**Deciders:** @team

### Context
Agents need to suggest code improvements, but auto-modifying code breaks developer trust.

### Decision
Agents create "Change Proposals" that require human approval before applying.

### Rationale
- ‚úÖ Developer trust (preview before apply)
- ‚úÖ Learning opportunity (devs understand WHY)
- ‚úÖ Safety (rollback points)
- ‚úÖ Control (can edit before applying)

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- High adoption rate (devs trust system)
- Better code quality (reviewed suggestions)
- Educational value

**Negative:**
- Extra step (not fully automated)
- Requires IDE integration for good UX

**Mitigations:**
- Make approval flow seamless in IDE
- Allow batch approval for doc updates
- Auto-approve for safe operations (optional)

## ADR-004: Git Agent as Single Git Authority

**Date:** 2025-10-14  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Accepted  
**Deciders:** @team

### Context
Multiple agents need to interact with Git, but direct access creates chaos.

### Decision
Only Git Agent can perform Git operations. Other agents emit events, Git Agent executes.

### Rationale
- ‚úÖ Single responsibility principle
- ‚úÖ Audit trail (all Git ops logged)
- ‚úÖ Rollback capability
- ‚úÖ Consistent commit messages
- ‚úÖ Git-flow enforcement

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easier to debug Git issues
- All operations auditable
- Rollback system centralized

**Negative:**
- Extra event hop (latency +100ms)
- More complex architecture
