# Agent System Improvements

## Background

After analyzing agent performance and collaboration patterns, the following improvements have been identified:

- Agents processed 3 events in this cycle.
- ‚è∏Ô∏è Idle agents: spec. Consider reviewing their triggers.
- üìã Spec Agent: Pre-commit hooks are critical technical specifications enforcement tools that prevent non-compliant code (e.g., failed linting or formatting) from polluting the repository state. Standardize hook configuration using specialized tools like `pre-commit.ci` or `Husky` to define specific validation stages, linking them directly to the linters and formatters required by your project specifications.

## Proposed Changes

### 1. Review event subscriptions for idle agents

**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Assigned to:** developer

**Implementation:**
- Update agent `__init__` to subscribe to new events
- Add handler method for new event type
- Test event flow with demo script


## Benefits

Implementing these changes will:
- Improve agent coordination and collaboration
- Reduce errors and edge cases
- Enhance system reliability
- Better developer experience

## Next Steps

1. Review this proposal
2. Approve to implement changes
3. Test with existing workflows
4. Monitor agent metrics in next retrospective
