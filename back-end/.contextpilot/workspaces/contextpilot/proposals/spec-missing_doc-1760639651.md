+# ContextPilot Architecture
+
+## Overview
+
+This document outlines the architecture of ContextPilot, a multi-agent AI system designed to enhance developer productivity through automated documentation, Git context management, and contribution rewarding. It details the key components, their interactions, and the technologies used.
+
+## Purpose/Objectives
+
+The primary objectives of this architecture are to:
+
+*   Provide a modular and scalable design to accommodate future features.
+*   Enable seamless integration of various AI models and services.
+*   Ensure data integrity and security.
+*   Optimize performance for real-time interaction with developers.
+*   Facilitate maintainability and ease of development.

+
+## Component Details
+
+1.  **Developer IDE:** The developer's Integrated Development Environment (e.g., VS Code, IntelliJ). This is where ContextPilot interacts with the user through extensions or plugins.
+
+2.  **ContextPilot Agent Manager:** The central orchestrator that manages the different agents. It receives requests from the IDE, routes them to the appropriate agent(s), and aggregates the responses. It also handles authentication and authorization.
+
+3.  **Documentation Agent:** Responsible for automatically generating and maintaining documentation. It utilizes an LLM to analyze code and generate documentation snippets. It also interacts with the Vector Database to store and retrieve documentation embeddings.
+
+4.  **Git Context Agent:**  Manages the developer's Git context. It tracks changes, suggests relevant branches, and provides insights into the codebase based on the current Git state. It interacts directly with the Git repository and the Vector Database.
+
+5.  **Reward Agent:**  Handles the rewarding of contributions with blockchain tokens. It tracks contributions, calculates rewards based on predefined criteria, and interacts with a blockchain service to distribute tokens.
+
+6.  **LLM (Language Model):** A large language model (e.g., GPT-4, Gemini) used by the Documentation Agent for generating documentation.
+
+7.  **Git Repository:** The Git repository containing the project's source code.
+
+8.  **Blockchain Service:** A blockchain platform (e.g., Ethereum, Polygon) used for managing and distributing contribution rewards.
+
+9.  **Vector Database:**  A database (e.g., Chroma, Pinecone) used to store vector embeddings of code, documentation, and Git commit messages. This allows for efficient semantic search and retrieval.
+
+## Technology Stack
+
+*   **Programming Languages:** Python, JavaScript/TypeScript
+*   **AI Frameworks:** TensorFlow, PyTorch
+*   **LLM APIs:** OpenAI API, Google AI API
+*   **Vector Database:** ChromaDB, Pinecone
+*   **Blockchain:** Ethereum, Polygon
+*   **Web Framework:** Flask, FastAPI (for Agent Manager API)
+*   **IDE Extension Framework:** VS Code API, IntelliJ Platform SDK
+
+## Data Flow
+
+1.  The developer interacts with ContextPilot through their IDE.
+2.  The IDE sends a request to the ContextPilot Agent Manager.
+3.  The Agent Manager routes the request to the appropriate agent(s).
+4.  The agents interact with the LLM, Git Repository, Blockchain Service, and Vector Database as needed.
+5.  The agents return a response to the Agent Manager.
+6.  The Agent Manager aggregates the responses and sends them back to the IDE.
+7.  The IDE displays the results to the developer.
+
+## Best Practices
+
+*   **Modularity:** Design each agent as a self-contained module with a well-defined API.
+*   **Asynchronous Communication:** Use asynchronous communication patterns (e.g., message queues) to improve performance and scalability.
+*   **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling to gracefully handle unexpected errors.
+*   **Security:** Secure all API endpoints and data stores.
+*   **Testing:** Write comprehensive unit and integration tests.
+*   **Monitoring:** Implement monitoring to track the performance and health of the system.
