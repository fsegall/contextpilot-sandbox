+# Project Title
+
+## Overview
+
+This document serves as the primary entry point for understanding and engaging with this project. It provides a high-level overview of the project's purpose, scope, and how to get started. Refer to `project_scope.md` for detailed information about what's included and excluded from this project.
+
+## Purpose/Objectives
+
+The primary objectives of this project are to:
+
+*   Develop a multi-agent AI system for [brief description of the system's purpose].
+*   Create a VSCode/Cursor extension to facilitate user interaction with the AI system.
+*   Integrate with Git for context tracking and version control.
+*   Implement a proposal approval workflow to manage AI-generated content.
+*   Establish a token rewards system for user contributions and engagement.
+
+## Usage
+
+### Prerequisites
+
+Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
+
+*   Node.js (version >= 16)
+*   npm (version >= 8) or yarn
+*   VSCode or Cursor (if you plan to use the extension)
+*   Git
+
+### Installation
+
+1.  **Clone the repository:**
+
+    ```bash
+    git clone [repository_url]
+    cd [project_directory]
+    ```
+
+2.  **Install dependencies:**
+
+    Using npm:
+
+    ```bash
+    npm install
+    ```
+
+    Using yarn:
+
+    ```bash
+    yarn install
+    ```
+
+3.  **Configuration:**
+
+    *   Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and update the environment variables with your specific configurations.  Ensure you have the necessary API keys and credentials.
+
+    ```bash
+    cp .env.example .env
+    # Edit .env with your configurations
+    ```
+
+### Running the Project
+
+Instructions will vary depending on the specific components of the project.  Refer to the documentation for each component (e.g., the VSCode extension, the multi-agent AI system) for specific instructions.
+
+**Example: Running the Multi-Agent AI System:**
+
+1.  Navigate to the directory containing the AI system's code.
+2.  Run the main script:
+
+    ```bash
+    node main.js
+    ```
+
+    (Replace `main.js` with the actual entry point of the AI system.)
+
+**Example: Building and Running the VSCode Extension:**
+
+1.  Navigate to the extension's directory.
+2.  Package the extension:
+
+    ```bash
+    vsce package
+    ```
+
+    (Requires the `vsce` tool: `npm install -g vsce`)
+
+3.  Install the extension in VSCode:  Use the "Install from VSIX..." option in the Extensions view.
+
+### Git Integration
+
+This project leverages Git for version control and context tracking.
+
+*   **Branching Strategy:**  Follow a [Git branching model](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) (e.g., Gitflow) for feature development and bug fixes.
+*   **Commit Messages:**  Write clear and concise commit messages that explain the purpose of each change.
+*   **Pull Requests:**  Submit pull requests for all code changes.  Ensure that your code is reviewed by at least one other team member before merging.
+
+## Code Examples
+
+(Specific code examples will be added as the project develops.)
+
+Example of setting an environment variable:
+
+```javascript
+// Accessing an environment variable
+const apiKey = process.env.API_KEY;
+
+if (!apiKey) {
+  console.error("API_KEY is not set in the environment.");
+}
+```
+
+## Best Practices
+
+*   **Code Style:**  Follow a consistent code style (e.g., using ESLint and Prettier).
+*   **Testing:**  Write unit tests and integration tests to ensure the quality of the code.
+*   **Documentation:**  Document your code clearly and concisely.  Use JSDoc or similar tools to generate API documentation.
+*   **Security:**  Follow security best practices to protect against vulnerabilities (e.g., input validation, secure authentication).
+*   **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling to gracefully handle unexpected situations.
+*   **Environment Variables:** Use environment variables for configuration settings that may vary between environments.
+*   **Dependency Management:**  Keep your dependencies up to date and manage them carefully to avoid conflicts.
