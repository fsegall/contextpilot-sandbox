User Interface\n+\n+*   **Technology:**  React, HTML, CSS\n+*   **Responsibility:**  Provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with ContextPilot.  Allows users to trigger actions, view documentation, and manage rewards.  Handles user authentication and authorization.\n+*   **Interaction:**  Communicates with the Agent Orchestrator via API calls (e.g., REST, GraphQL).\n+\n+### 2. Agent Orchestrator\n+\n+*   **Technology:** Python (e.g., FastAPI, Flask)\n+*   **Responsibility:**  Manages the execution of the different agents.  Receives requests from the UI, determines which agent(s) should handle the request, and coordinates their execution. Handles error handling and logging.\n+*   **Interaction:**  Communicates with the User Interface via API calls. Communicates with the Documentation Agent, Git Context Agent, and Reward Agent via internal function calls or message queues (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka).\n+\n+### 3. Documentation Agent\n+\n+*   **Technology:** Python (e.g., Langchain, Transformers)\n+*   **Responsibility:**  Automatically generates and updates documentation based on code analysis.  Supports multiple documentation formats (e.g., Markdown, HTML).  Can extract information from code comments, docstrings, and commit messages.\n+*   **Interaction:**  Receives requests from the Agent Orchestrator.  Stores and retrieves documentation from the Documentation Database.\n+\n+### 4. Git Context Agent\n+\n+*   **Technology:** Python (e.g., GitPython)\n+*   **Responsibility:**  Analyzes the Git repository to provide context-aware information to the user.  Can identify relevant code changes, branches, and commit messages.  Helps developers understand the history and evolution of the codebase.\n+*   **Interaction:**  Receives requests from the Agent Orchestrator.  Interacts directly with the Git Repository.\n+\n+### 5. Reward Agent\n+\n+*   **Technology:** Python, Blockchain SDK (e.g., web3.py)\n+*   **Responsibility:**  Tracks and rewards developer contributions with blockchain tokens.  Implements a reward system based on code quality, documentation, and community involvement.  Manages token distribution and user balances.\n+*   **Interaction:**  Receives requests from the Agent Orchestrator.  Interacts with the Blockchain Interface to manage token transactions.\n+\n+### 6. Documentation Database\n+\n+*   **Technology:**  Vector Database (e.g., ChromaDB, Pinecone), SQL Database (e.g., PostgreSQL)\n+*   **Responsibility:**  Stores the generated documentation in a structured format.  Supports efficient search and retrieval of documentation based on keywords and semantic similarity.  The Vector database is used for storing embeddings of the documentation, and the SQL database can be used for storing metadata.\n+\n+### 7. Git Repository\n+\n+*   **Technology:** Git\n+*   **Responsibility:**  Stores the source code and version history of the project.\n+*   **Interaction:**  The Git Context Agent directly interacts with the Git Repository to analyze the codebase.\n+\n+### 8. Blockchain Interface\n+\n+*   **Technology:** Blockchain (e.g., Ethereum, Polygon), Smart Contracts\n+*   **Responsibility:**  Provides an interface for interacting with the blockchain.  Manages token transactions and user accounts.  Ensures the security and transparency of the reward system.\n+*   **Interaction:**  The Reward Agent interacts with the Blockchain Interface to manage token transactions.\n+\n+## Data Flow\n+\n+1.  A user interacts with the User Interface to request a specific action (e.g., generate documentation, view Git context, claim rewards).\n+2.  The User Interface sends the request to the Agent Orchestrator.\n+3.  The Agent Orchestrator determines which agent(s) should handle the request.\n+4.  The Agent Orchestrator invokes the appropriate agent(s) and passes the request parameters.\n+5.  The agent(s) perform their tasks, potentially interacting with external resources (e.g., Documentation Database, Git Repository, Blockchain Interface).\n+6.  The agent(s) return the results to the Agent Orchestrator.\n+7.  The Agent Orchestrator formats the results and sends them back to the User Interface.\n+8.  The User Interface displays the results to the user.\n+\n+## Best Practices\n+\n+*   **Modularity:**  Design components to be independent and reusable.\n+*   **Loose Coupling:**  Minimize dependencies between components.\n+*   **Scalability:**  Design the system to handle increasing workloads.\n+*   **Maintainability:**  Write clear, concise, and well-documented code.\n+*   **Security:**  Implement appropriate security measures to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access.\n+*   **Asynchronous Communication:** Utilize asynchronous messaging queues (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka) for improved performance and resilience, especially for communication between agents.\n+*   **Microservices:** Consider refactoring into a microservices architecture for independent deployment and scaling of individual components.\n+\n+## References\n+\n+*   [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)\n+*   [Langchain](https://www.langchain.com/)\n+*   [GitPython](https://gitpython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)\n+*   [web3.py](https://web3py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)\n+*   [ChromaDB](https://www.trychroma.com/)\n+*   [Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io/)\n+```"
