  "description": "# Agent System Improvements\n\n**Generated from Retrospective:** retro-20251018-143502\n**Date:** 2025-10-18T14:35:02.333003+00:00\n\n## Background\n\nAfter analyzing agent performance and collaboration patterns, the following improvements have been identified:\n\n- Agents processed 3 events in this cycle.\n- \u23f8\ufe0f Idle agents: spec. Consider reviewing their triggers.\n- \ud83d\udccb Spec Agent: Pre-commit hooks are critical technical specifications enforcement tools that prevent non-compliant code (e.g., failed linting or formatting) from polluting the repository state. Standardize hook configuration using specialized tools like `pre-commit.ci` or `Husky` to define specific validation stages, linking them directly to the linters and formatters required by your project specifications.\n\n## Proposed Changes\n\n### 1. Review event subscriptions for idle agents\n\n**Priority:** MEDIUM\n**Assigned to:** developer\n\n**Implementation:**\n- Update agent `__init__` to subscribe to new events\n- Add handler method for new event type\n- Test event flow with demo script\n\n\n## Benefits\n\nImplementing these changes will:\n- Improve agent coordination and collaboration\n- Reduce errors and edge cases\n- Enhance system reliability\n- Better developer experience\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. Review this proposal\n2. Approve to implement changes\n3. Test with existing workflows\n4. Monitor agent metrics in next retrospective\n\n---\n\n*This proposal was automatically generated by the Retrospective Agent based on agent performance analysis.*\n",
