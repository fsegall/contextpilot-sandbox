+# Project Overview
+
+This document provides a comprehensive overview of the project, including its purpose, usage instructions, and best practices. It serves as the primary entry point for developers and users to understand and interact with the project.
+
+## 🎯 Purpose and Objectives
+
+The main objectives of this project are:
+
+*   To develop a multi-agent AI system.
+*   To create a VSCode/Cursor extension for enhanced development workflow.
+*   To integrate Git for context tracking and version control.
+*   To implement a proposal approval workflow.
+*   To incorporate a token rewards system.
+
+## 🛠️ Usage Instructions
+
+This section details how to set up, configure, and use the project components.
+
+### Prerequisites
+
+Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
+
+*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version >= 16)
+*   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (version >= 8) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
+*   [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
+*   [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [Cursor](https://cursor.sh/)
+
+### Installation
+
+1.  **Clone the repository:**
+
+    ```bash
+    git clone <repository_url>
+    cd <project_directory>
+    ```
+
+2.  **Install dependencies:**
+
+    Using npm:
+
+    ```bash
+    npm install
+    ```
+
+    Using Yarn:
+
+    ```bash
+    yarn install
+    ```
+
+### Configuration
+
+1.  **Environment Variables:**
+
+    Create a `.env` file in the root directory and populate it with the necessary environment variables. Example:
+
+    ```
+    API_KEY=your_api_key
+    DATABASE_URL=your_database_url
+    ```
+
+2.  **VSCode/Cursor Extension:**
+
+    *   Open VSCode or Cursor.
+    *   Navigate to the Extensions view (`Ctrl+Shift+X` or `Cmd+Shift+X`).
+    *   Search for the extension (once available) and install it.
+    *   Follow the extension's specific configuration instructions (usually found in the extension's settings).
+
+### Running the Application
+
+1.  **Start the main application:**
+
+    ```bash
+    npm start
+    # or
+    yarn start
+    ```
+
+    This will typically start the backend server.  Consult the specific component's documentation for further instructions.
+
+2.  **Running the VSCode/Cursor Extension (Development):**
+
+    Refer to the extension's development documentation for instructions on building, installing, and running the extension in development mode within VSCode/Cursor.  This usually involves using the VSCode extension development tools.
+
+### Git Integration
+
+The project uses Git for version control.  Ensure you are familiar with basic Git commands:
+
+*   `git add .` - Stage changes
+*   `git commit -m "Your commit message"` - Commit changes
+*   `git push origin main` - Push changes to the remote repository
+*   `git pull origin main` - Pull changes from the remote repository
+
+## 💡 Best Practices
+
+*   **Commit frequently:** Make small, logical commits with descriptive messages.
+*   **Use branches:** Create branches for new features or bug fixes.
+*   **Code reviews:** Conduct code reviews before merging changes.
+*   **Follow coding standards:** Adhere to the project's coding standards and linting rules.
+*   **Write documentation:** Document your code and provide clear instructions for usage.
+*   **Keep dependencies up-to-date:** Regularly update dependencies to ensure security and stability.
+*   **Use a virtual environment:** (Python projects) Isolate project dependencies.
