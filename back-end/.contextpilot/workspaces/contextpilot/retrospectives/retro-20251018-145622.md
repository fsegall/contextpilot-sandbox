## Agent Metrics

### SPEC
- **events_processed:** 0
- **events_published:** 5
- **errors:** 0

### GIT
- **events_processed:** 3
- **events_published:** 1
- **errors:** 0

## Insights

- Agents processed 3 events in this cycle.
- ‚è∏Ô∏è Idle agents: spec. Consider reviewing their triggers.
- üìã Spec Agent: Define quantifiable non-functional requirements (performance, security) early in the lifecycle to set clear success boundaries. Implement automated requirements traceability checks to ensure every feature is validated against its original technical specification before deployment.
- üîß Git Agent: Focus on integrating atomic commit logic (e.g., using `git add -p` style staging) directly into the extension's change-tracking mechanism to ensure code changes are versioned logically before being acted upon. Implement automated branch-specific pre-commit/pre-merge hook execution within the extension's CI/CD workflows to enforce quality gates earlier in the development cycle.

## LLM Summary

## Retrospective Summary

**What went well:**
- The system demonstrated excellent stability, processing 3 events with zero errors across all active agents.
- The Git Agent successfully handled its workload, showing solid integration with our version control process.
- We're generating highly specific, actionable insights for improving individual agent logic and workflows.

**What could be improved:**
- The Spec Agent was idle this cycle, highlighting a potential misconfiguration in its event triggers that we need to address.
- We can boost overall system efficiency by ensuring every agent is actively contributing.

**Key learnings:**
- For our Spec Agent, defining quantifiable non-functional requirements and automating traceability checks will set clearer boundaries for success.
- For our Git Agent, integrating atomic commits and pre-commit hooks will enforce quality gates earlier in the development cycle.

**Next cycle focus:**
- Our top priority is to review event subscriptions for the idle Spec Agent to ensure it becomes an active participant in the workflow.
