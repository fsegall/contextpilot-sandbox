Standardize hook configuration using specialized tools like `pre-commit.ci` or `Husky` to define specific validation stages, linking them directly to the linters and formatters required by your project specifications.",

  "llm_summary": "## Retrospective Summary\n\n**What went well:**\n- The system operated flawlessly with zero processing errors, demonstrating solid stability.\n- Agents generated valuable, actionable insights on automating code quality with pre-commit hooks.\n- The `git` agent was actively engaged, successfully processing its subscribed events.\n\n**What could be improved:**\n- The `spec` agent was idle this cycle, indicating its event triggers may need adjustment to ensure it's contributing effectively.\n- Overall system throughput was modest, and we can aim to increase the number of events processed.\n\n**Key learnings:**\n- Pre-commit hooks are a powerful mechanism for enforcing technical specifications and preventing non-compliant code from being committed.\n- Standardizing hook management with frameworks like `pre-commit` ensures consistent quality enforcement across all developer environments.\n\n**Next cycle focus:**\n- Our main priority is to review and refine the event subscriptions for the `spec` agent to restore its activity and ensure all agents are fully engaged."
