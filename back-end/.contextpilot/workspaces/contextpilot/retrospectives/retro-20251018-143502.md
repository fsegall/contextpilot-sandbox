## Insights

- Agents processed 3 events in this cycle.
- ‚è∏Ô∏è Idle agents: spec. Consider reviewing their triggers.
- üìã Spec Agent: Pre-commit hooks are critical technical specifications enforcement tools that prevent non-compliant code (e.g., failed linting or formatting) from polluting the repository state. Standardize hook configuration using specialized tools like `pre-commit.ci` or `Husky` to define specific validation stages, linking them directly to the linters and formatters required by your project specifications.
- üîß Git Agent: Automate hook management using the `pre-commit` framework; define your required checks (e.g., linters, formatters) in a `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file. Install it via `pre-commit install` to guarantee code quality standards are enforced consistently across all developer environments *before* Git accepts the commit.

## LLM Summary

## Retrospective Summary

**What went well:**
- The system operated flawlessly with zero processing errors, demonstrating solid stability.
- Agents generated valuable, actionable insights on automating code quality with pre-commit hooks.
- The `git` agent was actively engaged, successfully processing its subscribed events.

**What could be improved:**
- The `spec` agent was idle this cycle, indicating its event triggers may need adjustment to ensure it's contributing effectively.
- Overall system throughput was modest, and we can aim to increase the number of events processed.

**Key learnings:**
- Pre-commit hooks are a powerful mechanism for enforcing technical specifications and preventing non-compliant code from being committed.
- Standardizing hook management with frameworks like `pre-commit` ensures consistent quality enforcement across all developer environments.

**Next cycle focus:**
- Our main priority is to review and refine the event subscriptions for the `spec` agent to restore its activity and ensure all agents are fully engaged.
