+# Architecture Overview
+
+This document provides a high-level overview of the system architecture, its key components, and their interactions. It serves as a guide for developers, stakeholders, and anyone seeking to understand the design and structure of the system. This document should be kept up-to-date as the architecture evolves.  Refer to `project_scope.md` for project context.
+
+## 1. Purpose and Objectives
+
+The primary purpose of this document is to:
+
+*   Provide a clear and concise description of the system's architecture.
+*   Outline the key components and their responsibilities.
+*   Explain how the components interact with each other.
+*   Serve as a reference for developers and stakeholders.
+*   Guide future development and maintenance efforts.
+*   Ensure architectural consistency across the system.
+
+The key objectives of the architecture are to:
+
+*   **Scalability:** The system should be able to handle increasing workloads without significant performance degradation.
+*   **Maintainability:** The system should be easy to understand, modify, and extend.
+*   **Reliability:** The system should be robust and resilient to failures.
+*   **Security:** The system should be secure and protect sensitive data.
+*   **Performance:** The system should provide a responsive and efficient user experience.
+*   **Testability:** The system should be designed to facilitate comprehensive testing.
+

+```
+
+*This diagram illustrates a simplified view of the architecture. More detailed diagrams may be found in the relevant component documentation.*
+
+## 3. Key Components
+
+The system consists of the following key components:
+
+*   **User Interface (UI):** The entry point for users to interact with the system.  This may include web, mobile, or command-line interfaces.
+*   **Load Balancer:** Distributes incoming traffic across multiple web servers to ensure high availability and performance.
+*   **Web Servers:** Handle HTTP requests and serve static content.
+*   **Application Server:** Executes the core business logic and interacts with the database and other services.
+*   **Database:** Stores persistent data.
+*   **Cache:** Stores frequently accessed data to improve performance.
+*   **Static Content Server:** Serves static assets such as images, CSS, and JavaScript files.
+
+### 3.1 Component Details
+
+*   **UI:** (Implementation details specific to the UI - technology stack, frameworks used, communication protocols).
+*   **Load Balancer:** (Specific load balancer technology, configuration details, health check mechanisms).
+*   **Web Servers:** (Technology stack, web server software, deployment configuration).
+*   **Application Server:** (Technology stack, framework, API endpoints, security considerations).
+*   **Database:** (Database system, schema design, data access patterns, backup and recovery procedures).
+*   **Cache:** (Caching strategy, technology used, eviction policies).
+*   **Static Content Server:** (Technology used, content delivery network (CDN) integration).
+
+*Further details on each component can be found in their respective documentation.*
+
+## 4. Data Flow
+
+1.  A user interacts with the UI, which sends a request to the Load Balancer.
+2.  The Load Balancer distributes the request to one of the available Web Servers.
+3.  The Web Server forwards the request to the Application Server.
+4.  The Application Server processes the request and interacts with the Database and Cache as needed.
+5.  The Application Server returns a response to the Web Server.
+6.  The Web Server sends the response back to the user through the Load Balancer.
+
+## 5. Technology Stack
+
+The system utilizes the following technologies:
+
+*   **Programming Languages:** (e.g., Java, Python, JavaScript)
+*   **Frameworks:** (e.g., Spring, React, Angular)
+*   **Databases:** (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB)
+*   **Caching:** (e.g., Redis, Memcached)
+*   **Operating Systems:** (e.g., Linux, Windows)
+*   **Cloud Platform:** (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP)
+
+*Specific versions and configurations are documented in the deployment documentation.*
+
+## 6. Best Practices
+
+The following best practices are followed in the system architecture:
+
+*   **Microservices Architecture:** The system is designed as a collection of loosely coupled, independently deployable services. (If applicable)
+*   **RESTful APIs:**  API communication follows RESTful principles.
+*   **Separation of Concerns:** Each component has a well-defined responsibility.
+*   **Loose Coupling:** Components are designed to minimize dependencies on each other.
+*   **Single Responsibility Principle:** Each class/module should have only one reason to change.
+*   **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):** Code should be reused whenever possible.
+*   **Secure Coding Practices:** Security is a priority throughout the development process.
