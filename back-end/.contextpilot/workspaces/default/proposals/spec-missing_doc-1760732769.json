The key objectives are:\n+\n+*   **Scalability:** The architecture should be able to handle increasing workloads and data volumes without significant performance degradation.\n+*   **Maintainability:** The codebase should be easy to understand, modify, and extend. Modularity and clear separation of concerns are crucial.\n+*   **Robustness:** The system should be resilient to failures and able to recover gracefully.\n+*   **Testability:** The architecture should facilitate thorough testing at all levels (unit, integration, and system).\n+*   **Security:**  Security considerations should be integrated into the architecture from the beginning.\n+*   **Flexibility:** The architecture should be adaptable to evolving requirements and new technologies.\n+\n+## 2. High-Level Architecture\n+\n+[**Note:** This section requires project-specific details to be truly useful.

This could be a web application, a mobile app, or a command-line interface.  (e.g., React, Angular, Vue.js for web apps)\n+*   **Application Layer (Business Logic):**  Implements the core business logic and orchestrates the interactions between the other layers.  (e.g., Java Spring, .NET, Node.js with Express)\n+*   **Data Access Layer:** Provides an abstraction layer for accessing and manipulating data.  This layer interacts with the underlying data storage systems. (e.g., JPA, Entity Framework, Mongoose)\n+*   **Data Storage Layer:** Persists data. This could be a relational database, a NoSQL database, or a file system. (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, AWS S3)\n+\n+These layers communicate through well-defined interfaces, promoting loose coupling and independent development.
