The Web Server forwards the request to the Application Server.\n+4.  The Application Server processes the request and interacts with the Database and Cache as needed.\n+5.  The Application Server returns a response to the Web Server.\n+6.  The Web Server sends the response back to the user through the Load Balancer.\n+\n+## 5. Technology Stack\n+\n+The system utilizes the following technologies:\n+\n+*   **Programming Languages:** (e.g., Java, Python, JavaScript)\n+*   **Frameworks:** (e.g., Spring, React, Angular)\n+*   **Databases:** (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB)\n+*   **Caching:** (e.g., Redis, Memcached)\n+*   **Operating Systems:** (e.g., Linux, Windows)\n+*   **Cloud Platform:** (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP)\n+\n+*Specific versions and configurations are documented in the deployment documentation.*\n+\n+## 6. Best Practices\n+\n+The following best practices are followed in the system architecture:\n+\n+*   **Microservices Architecture:** The system is designed as a collection of loosely coupled, independently deployable services. (If applicable)\n+*   **RESTful APIs:**  API communication follows RESTful principles.\n+*   **Separation of Concerns:** Each component has a well-defined responsibility.\n+*   **Loose Coupling:** Components are designed to minimize dependencies on each other.\n+*   **Single Responsibility Principle:** Each class/module should have only one reason to change.\n+*   **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):** Code should be reused whenever possible.\n+*   **Secure Coding Practices:** Security is a priority throughout the development process.\n+\n+## 7.
