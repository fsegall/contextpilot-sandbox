## Background

After analyzing agent performance and collaboration patterns, the following improvements have been identified:

- ‚è∏Ô∏è Idle agents: spec, git. Consider reviewing their triggers.
- üìã Spec Agent: Upon approval of any scope change request (SCR), mandate an immediate update and validation of the Scope-Milestone Traceability Matrix to confirm direct linkages are adjusted or created. I will then formally review the revised milestones' acceptance criteria against the new requirements baseline, ensuring they accurately reflect the expanded or reduced technical scope before re-baselining the schedule.
- üîß Git Agent: Treat the project plan and milestones as versioned configuration files requiring a pull request (PR) for modification, ensuring atomic traceability. This PR must explicitly link to the approved scope change ticket/commit, mandating a project lead review before merging the updated schedule.

## Proposed Changes

### 1. Review event subscriptions for idle agents

**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Assigned to:** developer

**Implementation:**
- Update agent `__init__` to subscribe to new events
- Add handler method for new event type
- Test event flow with demo script


## Benefits

Implementing these changes will:
- Improve agent coordination and collaboration
- Reduce errors and edge cases
- Enhance system reliability
- Better developer experience

## Next Steps

1. Review this proposal
2. Approve to implement changes
3. Test with existing workflows
4. Monitor agent metrics in next retrospective
