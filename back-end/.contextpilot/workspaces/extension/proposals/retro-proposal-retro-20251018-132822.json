  "description": "# Agent System Improvements\n\n**Generated from Retrospective:** retro-20251018-132822\n**Date:** 2025-10-18T13:28:22.939321+00:00\n\n## Background\n\nAfter analyzing agent performance and collaboration patterns, the following improvements have been identified:\n\n- \u23f8\ufe0f Idle agents: spec, git. Consider reviewing their triggers.\n- \ud83d\udccb Spec Agent: For 'manual', we need clear specifications defining requirements and validation criteria for successful implementation.\n- \ud83d\udd27 Git Agent: About 'manual', I suggest implementing automated detection via git hooks and workflow automation to streamline the process.\n\n## Proposed Changes\n\n### 1. Review event subscriptions for idle agents\n\n**Priority:** MEDIUM\n**Assigned to:** developer\n\n**Implementation:**\n- Update agent `__init__` to subscribe to new events\n- Add handler method for new event type\n- Test event flow with demo script\n\n\n## Benefits\n\nImplementing these changes will:\n- Improve agent coordination and collaboration\n- Reduce errors and edge cases\n- Enhance system reliability\n- Better developer experience\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. Review this proposal\n2. Approve to implement changes\n3. Test with existing workflows\n4. Monitor agent metrics in next retrospective\n\n---\n\n*This proposal was automatically generated by the Retrospective Agent based on agent performance analysis.*\n",
