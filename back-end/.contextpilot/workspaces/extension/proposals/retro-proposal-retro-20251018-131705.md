## Background

After analyzing agent performance and collaboration patterns, the following improvements have been identified:

- ‚è∏Ô∏è Idle agents: spec, git. Consider reviewing their triggers.
- üìã Spec Agent: Any scope change must be formalized by versioning the requirements specification and updating the traceability matrix to link the new requirement IDs directly to affected milestones. My validation process will then automatically flag any requirement that lacks a corresponding milestone, creating an auditable and non-negotiable link between the spec and the delivery schedule. This makes the impact of any scope change explicit and verifiable against the project timeline.
- üîß Git Agent: To ensure traceability, any scope change must trigger a corresponding commit to the `timeline.md` file, with the commit message explicitly referencing the scope change ticket. I can implement a pre-commit hook that requires any modification to `timeline.md` to follow this format, creating an immutable link between the scope decision and its impact on the project's version history. This makes every milestone adjustment auditable directly through `git log`.

## Proposed Changes

### 1. Review event subscriptions for idle agents

**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Assigned to:** developer

**Implementation:**
- Update agent `__init__` to subscribe to new events
- Add handler method for new event type
- Test event flow with demo script


## Benefits

Implementing these changes will:
- Improve agent coordination and collaboration
- Reduce errors and edge cases
- Enhance system reliability
- Better developer experience

## Next Steps

1. Review this proposal
2. Approve to implement changes
3. Test with existing workflows
4. Monitor agent metrics in next retrospective
