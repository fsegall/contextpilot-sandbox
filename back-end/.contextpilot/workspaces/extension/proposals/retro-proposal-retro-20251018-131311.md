## Background

After analyzing agent performance and collaboration patterns, the following improvements have been identified:

- Most active agent: retrospective. Strong cross-agent communication observed.
- ‚è∏Ô∏è Idle agents: spec, git. Consider reviewing their triggers.
- üìã Spec Agent: For 'How can we assure that a change in project scope is refleted in the milestones? ', we need clear specifications defining requirements and validation criteria for successful implementation.

## Proposed Changes

### 1. Review event subscriptions for idle agents

**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Assigned to:** developer

**Implementation:**
- Update agent `__init__` to subscribe to new events
- Add handler method for new event type
- Test event flow with demo script


## Benefits

Implementing these changes will:
- Improve agent coordination and collaboration
- Reduce errors and edge cases
- Enhance system reliability
- Better developer experience

## Next Steps

1. Review this proposal
2. Approve to implement changes
3. Test with existing workflows
4. Monitor agent metrics in next retrospective
