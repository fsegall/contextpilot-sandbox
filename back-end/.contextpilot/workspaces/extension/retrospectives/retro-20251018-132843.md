## Insights

- Most active agent: retrospective. Strong cross-agent communication observed.
- ‚è∏Ô∏è Idle agents: spec, git. Consider reviewing their triggers.
- üìã Spec Agent: For 'How do we assure that a change in project scope is reflected in the milestones?', we need clear specifications defining requirements and validation criteria for successful implementation.
- üîß Git Agent: About 'How do we assure that a change in project scope is reflected in the milestones?', I suggest implementing automated detection via git hooks and workflow automation to streamline the process.

## LLM Summary

## Retrospective Summary

**What went well:**
- Excellent cross-agent communication was observed, with the retrospective agent effectively facilitating collaboration.
- Agents proactively offered distinct and valuable solutions for handling changes in project scope, showcasing strong problem-solving capabilities.

**What could be improved:**
- The `spec` and `git` agents remained idle this cycle, indicating a potential gap in their event triggers.
- We can improve overall system efficiency by ensuring all agents are actively participating and processing relevant events.

**Key learnings:**
- For managing scope changes, clear specifications with defined requirements and validation criteria are crucial for success.
- Automating change detection through git hooks and workflows offers a powerful way to streamline our processes.

**Next cycle focus:**
- Our primary focus will be on activating our idle agents by reviewing and refining their event subscriptions to ensure full system engagement.
