## Insights

- ‚è∏Ô∏è Idle agents: spec, git. Consider reviewing their triggers.
- üìã Spec Agent: For 'How can we assure that a change in project scope is reflected in the milestones? ', we need clear specifications defining requirements and validation criteria for successful implementation.
- üîß Git Agent: About 'How can we assure that a change in project scope is reflected in the milestones? ', I suggest implementing automated detection via git hooks and workflow automation to streamline the process.

## LLM Summary

## Retrospective Summary

**What went well:**
- The system operated with excellent stability, reporting zero errors across all agents.
- Our agents demonstrated strong collaborative potential, offering complementary insights on managing scope changes.
- We received proactive, valuable suggestions that give us a clear direction for process improvement.

**What could be improved:**
- Agent activity was low this cycle, with the `spec` and `git` agents remaining idle.
- We need to ensure the agents are correctly configured to process relevant events and contribute actively.

**Key learnings:**
- Effectively managing scope changes requires both clear specifications and workflow automation, a powerful combination suggested by our agents.
- Idle agents are a key indicator that we should review their triggers and event subscriptions to ensure they are engaged.

**Next cycle focus:**
- Our primary goal is to re-engage our idle agents by reviewing and updating their event subscriptions.
