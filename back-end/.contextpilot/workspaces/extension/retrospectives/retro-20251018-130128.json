  "llm_summary": "## Retrospective Summary\n\n**What went well:**\n- The system operated with excellent stability, logging zero errors.\n- We saw strong collaborative focus, with multiple agents providing valuable, specialized insights on the single topic of improving documentation context.\n- The system's self-monitoring worked as intended, successfully identifying the idle `retrospective` agent.\n\n**What could be improved:**\n- Agent idleness needs to be addressed to ensure all components are actively contributing and processing events.\n- We have a clear gap in our process for incorporating new documentation into the system's shared context.\n\n**Key learnings:**\n- Effective knowledge management is a cross-functional concern, requiring a coordinated strategy from specifications to implementation and tracking.\n- A single, well-posed question can trigger a cascade of useful, system-wide analysis from our specialized agents.\n\n**Next cycle focus:**\n- Develop and implement a clear, automated process for adding and indexing new documentation.\n- Investigate and resolve the cause of the `retrospective` agent's idleness."
