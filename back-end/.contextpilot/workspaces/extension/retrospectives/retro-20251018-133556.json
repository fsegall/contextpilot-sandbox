The `spec` and `git` agents remained idle, suggesting their event triggers may need adjustment.\n- We need to ensure agents are correctly configured to process events and generate learnings from their operations.\n\n**Key learnings:**\n- Treating project plans like versioned code, managed via pull requests, will significantly improve traceability and change control.\n- For any scope change, we must immediately update our traceability matrix to maintain clear alignment between scope and milestones.\n\n**Next cycle focus:**\n- Our primary priority is to review and correct the event subscriptions for our idle agents to ensure they are fully operational."
