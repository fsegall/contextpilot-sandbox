## LLM Summary

## Retrospective Summary

**What went well:**
- The system demonstrated excellent stability, with zero errors reported from the retrospective agent.
- Valuable data is being generated, with the agent successfully publishing 4 events this cycle.
- Our monitoring proved effective, automatically identifying actionable insights for improvement.

**What could be improved:**
- Agent utilization needs attention. The `retrospective` agent remained idle, processing no events, which points to a potential gap in the data flow.
- We can enhance overall system efficiency by ensuring all agents are correctly subscribed to their trigger events.

**Key learnings:**
- Monitoring agent activity (events processed) is just as critical as monitoring output (events published) to ensure full system health.
- An idle agent is a primary indicator of a misconfiguration in its event triggers or subscriptions.

**Next cycle focus:**
- Our priority is to diagnose and resolve agent idleness. We will review the event subscriptions for the `retrospective` agent to ensure it is properly integrated.
