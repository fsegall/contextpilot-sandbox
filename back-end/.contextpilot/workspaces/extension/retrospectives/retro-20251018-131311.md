## Insights

- Most active agent: retrospective. Strong cross-agent communication observed.
- ‚è∏Ô∏è Idle agents: spec, git. Consider reviewing their triggers.
- üìã Spec Agent: For 'How can we assure that a change in project scope is refleted in the milestones? ', we need clear specifications defining requirements and validation criteria for successful implementation.
- üîß Git Agent: About 'How can we assure that a change in project scope is refleted in the milestones? ', I suggest implementing automated detection via git hooks and workflow automation to streamline the process.

## Action Items

- [MEDIUM] Review event subscriptions for idle agents (Assigned: developer)

## LLM Summary

## Retrospective Summary

**What went well:**
- The retrospective agent showed high activity, facilitating excellent system-wide reflection.
- We observed strong cross-agent communication, which is a solid foundation for collaboration.

**What could be improved:**
- The `spec` and `git` agents remained idle, missing opportunities to contribute to the workflow.
- Our process for capturing and logging explicit learnings from each agent can be enhanced.

**Key learnings:**
- Managing scope changes requires a two-pronged approach: clear specifications for requirements and automated detection via git hooks to ensure milestones are updated.
- Our agents possess valuable, specialized insights that we need to unlock.

**Next cycle focus:**
- Our primary goal is to review the event subscriptions for the idle `spec` and `git` agents to ensure they are correctly configured and activated.
