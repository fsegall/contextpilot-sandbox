  "llm_summary": "## Retrospective Summary\n\n**What went well:**\n- The system maintained perfect stability, with zero errors reported across all agents.\n- Our monitoring effectively identified idle agents, providing clear and actionable insights for improvement.\n- The system demonstrated strong self-reflection by suggesting specific enhancements for manual processes.\n\n**What could be improved:**\n- Agent activity was low, with the `spec` and `git` agents remaining idle throughout the cycle.\n- Our current manual triggers lack the efficiency that automation could provide.\n\n**Key learnings:**\n- For manual tasks to succeed, they require exceptionally clear specifications and validation criteria.\n- We can significantly streamline processes by automating agent triggers, for example, by using git hooks.\n- Proactive review of event subscriptions is essential to ensure agents are correctly configured to process work.\n\n**Next cycle focus:**\n- Our top priority is to review and optimize event subscriptions to resolve agent idleness.\n- We will begin planning the automation of manual workflows to improve overall system efficiency."
