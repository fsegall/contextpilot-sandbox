## Insights

- ‚è∏Ô∏è Idle agents: spec, git. Consider reviewing their triggers.
- üìã Spec Agent: For 'manual', we need clear specifications defining requirements and validation criteria for successful implementation.
- üîß Git Agent: About 'manual', I suggest implementing automated detection via git hooks and workflow automation to streamline the process.

## Action Items

- [MEDIUM] Review event subscriptions for idle agents (Assigned: developer)

## LLM Summary

## Retrospective Summary

**What went well:**
- The system demonstrated excellent stability, running with zero errors across all agents.
- Our monitoring successfully identified inactive agents, providing clear and actionable insights.
- We have established a solid, reliable foundation for future development cycles.

**What could be improved:**
- Agent activation needs attention, as the `spec` and `git` agents were idle and did not process any events.
- Our current workflow relies too heavily on manual triggers, which can be a bottleneck.

**Key learnings:**
- For manual processes to be effective, agents require very clear specifications and validation criteria.
- There's a significant opportunity to streamline our process by implementing automated triggers, such as git hooks for the `git` agent.

**Next cycle focus:**
- Our primary goal is to review and adjust event subscriptions to ensure all agents are correctly triggered and fully engaged in the workflow.
