## Insights

- ‚è∏Ô∏è Idle agents: retrospective. Consider reviewing their triggers.
- üì¶ Context Agent: 'How can we add relevant new documentation to context? ' relates to our context management strategy. We should ensure new content is properly indexed and tagged for retrieval.
- üìã Spec Agent: Regarding 'How can we add relevant new documentation to context? ', we need clear specifications for content inclusion criteria and validation rules.
- üîß Git Agent: For 'How can we add relevant new documentation to context? ', we should implement automated detection of new .md files and trigger context updates on commits.
- üéØ Coach Agent: 'How can we add relevant new documentation to context? ' suggests we need better developer guidance on when and how to add documentation to context.
- üèÅ Milestone Agent: 'How can we add relevant new documentation to context? ' indicates we should track documentation completeness as part of our milestone criteria.
- üß† Strategy Agent: 'How can we add relevant new documentation to context? ' requires a strategic approach to content curation and knowledge management across the project lifecycle.

## LLM Summary

## Retrospective Summary

**What went well:**
- The system operated with excellent stability, logging zero errors.
- We saw strong collaborative focus, with multiple agents providing valuable, specialized insights on the single topic of improving documentation context.
- The system's self-monitoring worked as intended, successfully identifying the idle `retrospective` agent.

**What could be improved:**
- Agent idleness needs to be addressed to ensure all components are actively contributing and processing events.
- We have a clear gap in our process for incorporating new documentation into the system's shared context.

**Key learnings:**
- Effective knowledge management is a cross-functional concern, requiring a coordinated strategy from specifications to implementation and tracking.
- A single, well-posed question can trigger a cascade of useful, system-wide analysis from our specialized agents.

**Next cycle focus:**
- Develop and implement a clear, automated process for adding and indexing new documentation.
- Investigate and resolve the cause of the `retrospective` agent's idleness.
