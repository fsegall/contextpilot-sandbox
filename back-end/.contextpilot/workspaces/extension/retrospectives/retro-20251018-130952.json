  "llm_summary": "## Retrospective Summary\n\n**What went well:**\n- System stability was excellent, with zero errors reported from our agents this cycle.\n- Our automated monitoring proved effective, successfully identifying an idle agent and generating a valuable process insight.\n\n**What could be improved:**\n- The `spec` agent remained idle, indicating its event triggers may need to be realigned with current workflows.\n- We have an opportunity to enhance our system's ability to generate automated learnings, as none were captured this period.\n\n**Key learnings:**\n- To handle scope changes effectively, we must start with clear specifications that define requirements and validation criteria.\n- An agent with zero activity is a key indicator that we need to review its event subscriptions to ensure it remains relevant.\n\n**Next cycle focus:**\n- Our priority is to investigate and resolve the `spec` agent's idleness by reviewing its event subscriptions."
