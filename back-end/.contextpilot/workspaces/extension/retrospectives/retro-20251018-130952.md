## Insights

- ‚è∏Ô∏è Idle agents: spec. Consider reviewing their triggers.
- üìã Spec Agent: For 'How can we assure that milestones are reviewed after a change in project scope? ', we need clear specifications defining requirements and validation criteria for successful implementation.

## LLM Summary

## Retrospective Summary

**What went well:**
- System stability was excellent, with zero errors reported from our agents this cycle.
- Our automated monitoring proved effective, successfully identifying an idle agent and generating a valuable process insight.

**What could be improved:**
- The `spec` agent remained idle, indicating its event triggers may need to be realigned with current workflows.
- We have an opportunity to enhance our system's ability to generate automated learnings, as none were captured this period.

**Key learnings:**
- To handle scope changes effectively, we must start with clear specifications that define requirements and validation criteria.
- An agent with zero activity is a key indicator that we need to review its event subscriptions to ensure it remains relevant.

**Next cycle focus:**
- Our priority is to investigate and resolve the `spec` agent's idleness by reviewing its event subscriptions.
