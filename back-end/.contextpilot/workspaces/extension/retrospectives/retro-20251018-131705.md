## Insights

- ‚è∏Ô∏è Idle agents: spec, git. Consider reviewing their triggers.
- üìã Spec Agent: Any scope change must be formalized by versioning the requirements specification and updating the traceability matrix to link the new requirement IDs directly to affected milestones. My validation process will then automatically flag any requirement that lacks a corresponding milestone, creating an auditable and non-negotiable link between the spec and the delivery schedule. This makes the impact of any scope change explicit and verifiable against the project timeline.
- üîß Git Agent: To ensure traceability, any scope change must trigger a corresponding commit to the `timeline.md` file, with the commit message explicitly referencing the scope change ticket. I can implement a pre-commit hook that requires any modification to `timeline.md` to follow this format, creating an immutable link between the scope decision and its impact on the project's version history. This makes every milestone adjustment auditable directly through `git log`.

## LLM Summary

## Retrospective Summary

**What went well:**
- The system maintained perfect stability, with zero errors reported from any agent.
- Our agents demonstrated proactive intelligence, formulating clear, sophisticated strategies for managing scope change and ensuring traceability even while idle.

**What could be improved:**
- The `spec` and `git` agents were inactive, suggesting a potential misalignment in their event triggers or a lack of relevant activity in the system for them to process.

**Key learnings:**
- Scope changes must be formally linked to milestones through versioned specifications and a traceability matrix to make their impact explicit and auditable.
- We can enforce timeline traceability by requiring commits that modify schedule files to reference the specific scope change ticket, creating an immutable audit trail.

**Next cycle focus:**
- Our primary goal is to activate our idle agents. We will review their event subscriptions to ensure they are correctly configured to process relevant system events.
