## Retrospective Summary

**What went well:**
- The system demonstrated excellent stability with zero errors during the cycle.
- Our monitoring capabilities successfully identified an idle agent, allowing us to catch a potential inefficiency.
- The `retrospective` agent correctly published its five output events as designed.

**What could be improved:**
- Agent activity was low for the `retrospective` agent, which processed no incoming events.
- We need to ensure agent event subscriptions are correctly configured to prevent underutilization.

**Key learnings:**
- An agent can be healthy but inactive if its triggers are not properly configured.
- Continuous monitoring is crucial for uncovering "silent" issues like idle agents.

**Next cycle focus:**
- Review and correct the event subscriptions for the `retrospective` agent to ensure it actively contributes to the system's workflow.
