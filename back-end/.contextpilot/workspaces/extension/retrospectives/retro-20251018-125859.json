  "llm_summary": "## Retrospective Summary\n\n**What went well:**\n- The `retrospective` agent showed strong outbound communication by successfully publishing 6 events.\n- The system demonstrated perfect stability, operating with zero errors during the cycle.\n- Cross-agent communication was initiated effectively, highlighting a solid foundation for collaboration.\n\n**What could be improved:**\n- Agent responsiveness needs attention, as the `retrospective` agent processed no incoming events.\n- The triggers for our agents may not be correctly configured, leading to one-way communication patterns.\n\n**Key learnings:**\n- While our agents are effective broadcasters, we need to ensure they are also active listeners.\n- System reliability is high, allowing us to focus on improving agent interaction and intelligence.\n\n**Next cycle focus:**\n- Enhance agent responsiveness by reviewing and optimizing event subscriptions and triggers for any idle agents."
