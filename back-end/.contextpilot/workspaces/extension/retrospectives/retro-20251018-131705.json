My validation process will then automatically flag any requirement that lacks a corresponding milestone, creating an auditable and non-negotiable link between the spec and the delivery schedule. This makes the impact of any scope change explicit and verifiable against the project timeline.",
    "\ud83d\udd27 Git Agent: To ensure traceability, any scope change must trigger a corresponding commit to the `timeline.md` file, with the commit message explicitly referencing the scope change ticket. I can implement a pre-commit hook that requires any modification to `timeline.md` to follow this format, creating an immutable link between the scope decision and its impact on the project's version history. This makes every milestone adjustment auditable directly through `git log`."

We will review their event subscriptions to ensure they are correctly configured to process relevant system events."
