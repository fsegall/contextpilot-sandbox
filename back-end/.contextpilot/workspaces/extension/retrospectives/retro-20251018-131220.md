## Insights

- ‚è∏Ô∏è Idle agents: spec, git. Consider reviewing their triggers.
- üìã Spec Agent: For 'manual', we need clear specifications defining requirements and validation criteria for successful implementation.
- üîß Git Agent: About 'manual', I suggest implementing automated detection via git hooks and workflow automation to streamline the process.

## Action Items

## LLM Summary

## Retrospective Summary

**What went well:**
- The system maintained perfect stability, with zero errors reported across all agents.
- Our monitoring effectively identified idle agents, providing clear and actionable insights for improvement.
- The system demonstrated strong self-reflection by suggesting specific enhancements for manual processes.

**What could be improved:**
- Agent activity was low, with the `spec` and `git` agents remaining idle throughout the cycle.
- Our current manual triggers lack the efficiency that automation could provide.

**Key learnings:**
- For manual tasks to succeed, they require exceptionally clear specifications and validation criteria.
- We can significantly streamline processes by automating agent triggers, for example, by using git hooks.
- Proactive review of event subscriptions is essential to ensure agents are correctly configured to process work.

**Next cycle focus:**
- Our top priority is to review and optimize event subscriptions to resolve agent idleness.
- We will begin planning the automation of manual workflows to improve overall system efficiency.
