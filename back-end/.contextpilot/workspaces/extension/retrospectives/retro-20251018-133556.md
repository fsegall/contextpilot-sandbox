## Insights

- ‚è∏Ô∏è Idle agents: spec, git. Consider reviewing their triggers.
- üìã Spec Agent: Upon approval of any scope change request (SCR), mandate an immediate update and validation of the Scope-Milestone Traceability Matrix to confirm direct linkages are adjusted or created. I will then formally review the revised milestones' acceptance criteria against the new requirements baseline, ensuring they accurately reflect the expanded or reduced technical scope before re-baselining the schedule.
- üîß Git Agent: Treat the project plan and milestones as versioned configuration files requiring a pull request (PR) for modification, ensuring atomic traceability. This PR must explicitly link to the approved scope change ticket/commit, mandating a project lead review before merging the updated schedule.

## LLM Summary

## Retrospective Summary

**What went well:**
- Our system demonstrated excellent stability, with zero errors reported across all agents.
- We generated insightful, proactive improvements for managing scope and project plan changes, showing strong reflective capabilities.

**What could be improved:**
- Agent engagement was low this cycle. The `spec` and `git` agents remained idle, suggesting their event triggers may need adjustment.
- We need to ensure agents are correctly configured to process events and generate learnings from their operations.

**Key learnings:**
- Treating project plans like versioned code, managed via pull requests, will significantly improve traceability and change control.
- For any scope change, we must immediately update our traceability matrix to maintain clear alignment between scope and milestones.

**Next cycle focus:**
- Our primary priority is to review and correct the event subscriptions for our idle agents to ensure they are fully operational.
