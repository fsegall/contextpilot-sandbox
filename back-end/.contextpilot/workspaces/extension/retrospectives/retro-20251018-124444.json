  "llm_summary": "## Retrospective Summary\n\n**What went well:**\n- The system demonstrated excellent stability, with zero errors reported from the retrospective agent.\n- Valuable data is being generated, with the agent successfully publishing 4 events this cycle.\n- Our monitoring proved effective, automatically identifying actionable insights for improvement.\n\n**What could be improved:**\n- Agent utilization needs attention. The `retrospective` agent remained idle, processing no events, which points to a potential gap in the data flow.\n- We can enhance overall system efficiency by ensuring all agents are correctly subscribed to their trigger events.\n\n**Key learnings:**\n- Monitoring agent activity (events processed) is just as critical as monitoring output (events published) to ensure full system health.\n- An idle agent is a primary indicator of a misconfiguration in its event triggers or subscriptions.\n\n**Next cycle focus:**\n- Our priority is to diagnose and resolve agent idleness. We will review the event subscriptions for the `retrospective` agent to ensure it is properly integrated."
