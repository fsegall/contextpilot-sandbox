  "llm_summary": "## Retrospective Summary\n\n**What went well:**\n- The system demonstrated excellent stability with zero errors during the cycle.\n- Our monitoring capabilities successfully identified an idle agent, allowing us to catch a potential inefficiency.\n- The `retrospective` agent correctly published its five output events as designed.\n\n**What could be improved:**\n- Agent activity was low for the `retrospective` agent, which processed no incoming events.\n- We need to ensure agent event subscriptions are correctly configured to prevent underutilization.\n\n**Key learnings:**\n- An agent can be healthy but inactive if its triggers are not properly configured.\n- Continuous monitoring is crucial for uncovering \"silent\" issues like idle agents.\n\n**Next cycle focus:**\n- Review and correct the event subscriptions for the `retrospective` agent to ensure it actively contributes to the system's workflow."
