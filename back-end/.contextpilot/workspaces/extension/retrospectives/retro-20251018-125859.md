## Retrospective Summary

**What went well:**
- The `retrospective` agent showed strong outbound communication by successfully publishing 6 events.
- The system demonstrated perfect stability, operating with zero errors during the cycle.
- Cross-agent communication was initiated effectively, highlighting a solid foundation for collaboration.

**What could be improved:**
- Agent responsiveness needs attention, as the `retrospective` agent processed no incoming events.
- The triggers for our agents may not be correctly configured, leading to one-way communication patterns.

**Key learnings:**
- While our agents are effective broadcasters, we need to ensure they are also active listeners.
- System reliability is high, allowing us to focus on improving agent interaction and intelligence.

**Next cycle focus:**
- Enhance agent responsiveness by reviewing and optimizing event subscriptions and triggers for any idle agents.
