  "llm_summary": "## Retrospective Summary\n\n**What went well:**\n- The system demonstrated excellent stability, running with zero errors across all agents.\n- Our monitoring successfully identified inactive agents, providing clear and actionable insights.\n- We have established a solid, reliable foundation for future development cycles.\n\n**What could be improved:**\n- Agent activation needs attention, as the `spec` and `git` agents were idle and did not process any events.\n- Our current workflow relies too heavily on manual triggers, which can be a bottleneck.\n\n**Key learnings:**\n- For manual processes to be effective, agents require very clear specifications and validation criteria.\n- There's a significant opportunity to streamline our process by implementing automated triggers, such as git hooks for the `git` agent.\n\n**Next cycle focus:**\n- Our primary goal is to review and adjust event subscriptions to ensure all agents are correctly triggered and fully engaged in the workflow."
