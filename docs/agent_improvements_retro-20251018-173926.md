# Agent System Improvements

**Generated from Retrospective:** retro-20251018-173926
**Date:** 2025-10-18T17:39:26.657332+00:00

## Background

After analyzing agent performance and collaboration patterns, the following improvements have been identified:

- ‚è∏Ô∏è Idle agents: spec. Consider reviewing their triggers.
- üì¶ Context Agent: Ensure all deployment configurations, environment variables, and runbook procedures are indexed and easily discoverable within a centralized knowledge base linked to specific services. We need better semantic tagging of deployment-related incidents for faster root cause analysis and future automation.
- üìã Spec Agent: Define clear, executable deployment specifications for each environment, including pre-flight checks and post-deployment validation criteria for automated verification. We must specify acceptable rollback strategies and their triggers.

## Proposed Changes

### 1. Review event subscriptions for idle agents

**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Assigned to:** developer

**Implementation:**
- Update agent `__init__` to subscribe to new events
- Add handler method for new event type
- Test event flow with demo script


## Benefits

Implementing these changes will:
- Improve agent coordination and collaboration
- Reduce errors and edge cases
- Enhance system reliability
- Better developer experience

## Next Steps

1. Review this proposal
2. Approve to implement changes
3. Test with existing workflows
4. Monitor agent metrics in next retrospective
