**Generated from Retrospective:** retro-20251020-150139
**Date:** 2025-10-20T15:01:39.112729+00:00

## Background

After analyzing agent performance and collaboration patterns, the following improvements have been identified:

- ‚è∏Ô∏è Idle agents: spec. Consider reviewing their triggers.
- üì¶ Context Agent: We need to retrieve and index existing data on user engagement, past reward system feedback, and related feature requests to inform our improvements. Let's also link this discussion to our documentation on user motivation principles.
- üìã Spec Agent: Define clear, measurable criteria for desired user behaviors and the exact conditions for reward distribution within a new technical specification. We must outline validation tests to ensure the updated system functions as intended and meets performance targets.

## Proposed Changes

### 1. Review event subscriptions for idle agents

**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Assigned to:** developer

**Implementation:**
- Update agent `__init__` to subscribe to new events
- Add handler method for new event type
- Test event flow with demo script


## Benefits

Implementing these changes will:
- Improve agent coordination and collaboration
- Reduce errors and edge cases
- Enhance system reliability
- Better developer experience

## Next Steps

1. Review this proposal
2. Approve to implement changes
3. Test with existing workflows
4. Monitor agent metrics in next retrospective
