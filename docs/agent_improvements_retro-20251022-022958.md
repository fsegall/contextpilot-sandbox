**Discussion Topic:** Do you think the interaction among agents has improved with recent changes to the code base? 

## Background

During the retrospective discussion on 'Do you think the interaction among agents has improved with recent changes to the code base? ', the following improvements were identified:

- ‚ö†Ô∏è 1 errors occurred across all agents. Review error logs.
- ‚è∏Ô∏è Idle agents: spec, development, context, coach, milestone. Consider reviewing their triggers.
- üìã Spec Agent: As a Spec Agent, determining true improvement in agent interaction necessitates immediate validation against updated inter-agent communication specifications and performance benchmarks. Action: Develop and execute targeted test cases to confirm whether observed communication patterns consistently meet the new, desired interaction requirements.

## Proposed Changes

### 1. Review error logs and fix agent error handling

**Priority:** HIGH
**Assigned to:** developer

**Implementation:**
- Review error logs in `.agent_state/` files
- Add try-catch blocks around agent operations
- Improve error reporting to event bus

### 2. Review error logs and fix agent error handling

**Priority:** HIGH
