# Agent System Improvements

**Generated from Retrospective:** retro-20251018-165217
**Date:** 2025-10-18T16:52:17.667862+00:00

## Background

After analyzing agent performance and collaboration patterns, the following improvements have been identified:

- ‚è∏Ô∏è Idle agents: spec. Consider reviewing their triggers.
- üì¶ Context Agent: We should implement a centralized knowledge base with robust semantic tagging and cross-referencing to ensure discoverability and context-aware retrieval for all documentation.
- üìã Spec Agent: All documentation, especially API specs and design documents, must directly reference and be validated against defined requirements and acceptance criteria, preventing discrepancies.

## Proposed Changes

### 1. Review event subscriptions for idle agents

**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Assigned to:** developer

**Implementation:**
- Update agent `__init__` to subscribe to new events
- Add handler method for new event type
- Test event flow with demo script


## Benefits

Implementing these changes will:
- Improve agent coordination and collaboration
- Reduce errors and edge cases
- Enhance system reliability
- Better developer experience

## Next Steps

1. Review this proposal
2. Approve to implement changes
3. Test with existing workflows
4. Monitor agent metrics in next retrospective
