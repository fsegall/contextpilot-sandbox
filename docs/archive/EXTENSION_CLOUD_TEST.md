## üöÄ How to Test

### Step 1: Open Extension Development Host

**In Cursor:**
1. Open the `extension` folder in Cursor
2. Press **F5** (or **Ctrl+F5**)
3. Extension Development Host window will open

**Or via Terminal:**
```bash
cd /home/fsegall/Desktop/New_Projects/google-context-pilot/extension
code --extensionDevelopmentPath=. /tmp/test-workspace
```

---

### Step 2: Open ContextPilot Sidebar

In the Extension Development Host window:
1. Look for the **rocket icon** (üöÄ) in the Activity Bar (left side)
2. Click it to open ContextPilot sidebar
3. You should see sections:
   - **CHANGE PROPOSALS**
   - **AGENTS**
   - **REWARDS**
   - **PROJECT CONTEXT**

---

### Step 3: Check Connection

**Look at the bottom status bar:**
- Should show: **ContextPilot** with token balance
- If it says "Disconnected", click "Connect to ContextPilot"

**Check Developer Console:**
1. Open Dev Tools: **Ctrl+Shift+I** (Linux) or **Cmd+Option+I** (Mac)
2. Go to **Console** tab
3. Look for logs:
   ```
   [ContextPilot] Extension activated - API: https://contextpilot-backend-898848898667.us-central1.run.app
   [ContextPilot] Auto-connect completed, refreshing providers...
   ```

---

### Step 4: View Proposals

**In the CHANGE PROPOSALS section:**
1. Expand the section
2. You should see existing proposals:
   - "Docs issue: README.md"
   - "Docs issue: API_SPEC.md"
   - etc.

**Click on a proposal to:**
- View the diff
- Ask Claude to review
- Approve or reject

---

### Step 5: Test Cloud Connection

**Open Terminal in Extension Dev Host:**

```bash
# Test health endpoint
curl https://contextpilot-backend-898848898667.us-central1.run.app/health

# Expected: {"status":"ok","version":"2.0.0"...}
```

**Or test from extension:**
1. Click on any proposal
2. Extension should load the diff from Cloud Run
3. If it works = CONNECTION SUCCESS! üéâ

---

## üß™ What to Check

### ‚úÖ Success Indicators

1. **Sidebar loads** - Shows proposals, agents, rewards
2. **Proposals clickable** - Can view diffs
3. **No 404 errors** - Cloud Run responding
4. **Console logs clean** - No red errors
5. **Claude integration works** - Can ask for review

### ‚ùå Failure Indicators

1. **"Failed to fetch proposals"** - Backend not responding
2. **404 errors** - Wrong URL
3. **CORS errors** - Need to enable CORS in backend
4. **Timeout errors** - Cloud Run cold start (wait 5s, retry)

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Extension Shows "No Proposals"

**Check 1: Backend is running**
```bash
curl https://contextpilot-backend-898848898667.us-central1.run.app/health
```

**Check 2: Proposals exist**
```bash
curl "https://contextpilot-backend-898848898667.us-central1.run.app/proposals?workspace_id=contextpilot"
```

**Check 3: Extension logs**
- Open Console (Ctrl+Shift+I)
- Look for errors
- Should see: `[ContextPilot] Fetched X proposals`

### CORS Errors

If you see: `Access to fetch ... has been blocked by CORS policy`

**Fix:** Add CORS middleware to backend (already should be OK with FastAPI default)

### Connection Timeout

**Cause:** Cloud Run cold start (first request takes ~5s)

**Fix:** Wait 5 seconds and click "Refresh" or retry
