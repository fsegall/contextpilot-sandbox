# Today's Progress - October 15, 2025 🚀

## 🎯 Major Milestones Achieved

### 1. ✅ Event-Driven Architecture (COMPLETE)
**Impact:** Foundation for scalable multi-agent system

- EventBus with Pub/Sub + In-Memory
- BaseAgent class with state management
- 30+ event types, 10 topics
- Spec Agent & Git Agent migrated
- GCP setup script

**Lines:** ~1,450  
**Time:** ~2 hours

---

### 2. ✅ Custom Artifacts System (COMPLETE)
**Impact:** Users can customize agent behavior without code

- artifacts.yaml configuration
- Natural language rules
- 3 new templates (scope, checklists)
- Producer/consumer relationships

**Lines:** ~800  
**Time:** ~1 hour

---

### 3. ✅ Proposal Approval Flow (COMPLETE)
**Impact:** Human-in-the-loop safety

- Auto-commit flag
- Proposal persistence
- Extension integration
- Context-aware messages

**Lines:** ~400  
**Time:** ~1 hour

---

### 4. ✅ AI-Assisted Review (COMPLETE)
**Impact:** Users can ask Claude to review proposals

- Proposals with complete diffs
- Diff viewer in extension
- Claude integration via clipboard
- Before/after content

**Lines:** ~800  
**Time:** ~2 hours

---

## 📊 Session Statistics

- **Total Lines:** ~3,850
- **Files Created:** 18
- **Files Modified:** 12
- **Commits:** 11
- **Time:** ~6 hours

## 🎨 Key Innovations

### 1. Event-Driven Multi-Agent System
```
Agents communicate via Pub/Sub events, not direct calls
→ Decoupled, scalable, observable
```

### 2. Custom Artifacts with Natural Language Rules
```
Users define agent behavior in YAML with prompts
→ No code changes needed for customization
```

### 3. Proposals with Diffs
```
Proposals include actual code changes (unified diffs)
→ Users see exactly what will change
```

### 4. Cloud AI + Local AI Combo
```
GCP agents generate proposals → Claude reviews → User decides
→ Best of both worlds!
```

## 🔥 Critical Insight

**Problem:** Users want to ask their AI: "Are these changes good?" before approving.

**Solution:** 
1. Proposals include complete diffs
2. Extension shows diff viewer
3. "Ask Claude" button prepares context
4. Opens Cursor Chat
5. Claude analyzes and advises
6. User makes informed decision

**Impact:** Builds trust in AI agents + leverages user's preferred AI!
