## 💡 Key Insights Discovered

### 1. **Custom Artifacts = Game Changer**
Realized that `.md` files can be used as "teaching materials" for agents:
- Users write specs in natural language
- Agents read and follow them
- Enables spec-driven development
- Gives users full control over AI behavior

**Example:**
```markdown
# project_scope.md
## Out of Scope
- ❌ Mobile app

## Rules for Spec Agent
Reject proposals for mobile features
```

**Result:** Spec Agent automatically rejects mobile proposals!

### 2. **Gemini Quality is Excellent**
Generated content is professional and useful:
- README with proper structure
- Comprehensive project scope
- Detailed feature templates

**Cost:** Free tier (15 req/min) is sufficient for demo!

### 3. **Event-Driven Architecture Works**
- Proposal approved → Event published
- Git Agent receives event
- Git Agent applies changes
- System is loosely coupled and scalable
