**Discussion Topic:** Can you identify any code that could be improved for the agents to interact and make good decisions?

## Background

During the retrospective discussion on 'Can you identify any code that could be improved for the agents to interact and make good decisions?', the following improvements were identified:

- ‚ö†Ô∏è 1 errors occurred across all agents. Review error logs.
- ‚è∏Ô∏è Idle agents: spec, development, context, coach, milestone. Consider reviewing their triggers.
- üìã Spec Agent: From a validation and requirements perspective, the core issue lies in code that **lacks explicit, enforced validation of incoming interaction messages and their conformance to defined communication protocols and data schemas**. Improve this by implementing rigorous **schema and protocol validation at every inbound message handler**, ensuring agents operate only on unambiguous, specified data to make informed decisions.

## Proposed Changes

### 1. Review error logs and fix agent error handling

**Priority:** HIGH
**Assigned to:** developer

**Implementation:**
- Review error logs in `.agent_state/` files
- Add try-catch blocks around agent operations
- Improve error reporting to event bus


## Benefits

Implementing these changes will:
- Improve agent coordination and collaboration
- Reduce errors and edge cases
- Enhance system reliability
- Better developer experience

## Next Steps

1. Review this proposal
2. Approve to implement changes
3. Test with existing workflows
4. Monitor agent metrics in next retrospective
