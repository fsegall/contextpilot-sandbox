# Session Summary - October 15, 2025

## 🎯 Major Achievements

### 1. ✅ Event-Driven Architecture (COMPLETE)
**Time:** ~2 hours  
**Lines of Code:** ~1,450

**What Was Built:**
- **EventBus Service** with dual implementation:
  - In-Memory (development, no GCP needed)
  - Pub/Sub (production, scalable)
- **BaseAgent Class** with:
  - Persistent state management (JSON)
  - Event subscription/publishing
  - Artifact consumption with rules
  - Memory methods: `remember()`, `recall()`, `forget()`
  - Metrics tracking
- **30+ Event Types** defined
- **10 Pub/Sub Topics** configured
- **GCP Setup Script** (`setup-pubsub.sh`)

**Agents Migrated:**
- ✅ Spec Agent → Publishes `proposal.created.v1`
- ✅ Git Agent → Subscribes to `proposal.approved.v1`

**Key Innovation:**
- Agents communicate via events, not direct calls
- Completely decoupled architecture
- Easy to add new agents
- Observable event flow

**Commits:**
- `d1ebf92` - feat(event-bus): implement event-driven architecture
- `4c66d71` - docs: add event bus implementation summary

---

### 2. ✅ Custom Artifacts System (COMPLETE)
**Time:** ~1 hour  
**Lines of Code:** ~800

**What Was Built:**
- **artifacts.yaml** configuration system
- Natural language rules for agent behavior
- Producer/consumer relationships
- Three new artifact templates:
  - `project_scope.md` - Project boundaries
  - `project_checklist.md` - Master checklist (43 items)
  - `daily_checklist.md` - Daily tasks

**Key Features:**
- Users define agent behavior with natural language (no code!)
- Same artifact, different rules per agent
- Version controlled with workspace
- Flexible and extensible

**Example:**
```yaml
project_scope.md:
  consumers: [spec, strategy]
  agent_rules:
    spec: "Reject proposals outside defined scope"
    strategy: "Align milestones with scope goals"
```

**Commits:**
- `1045b12` - feat(artifacts): implement custom artifacts system
- `784fde8` - docs: add custom artifacts summary

---

### 3. ✅ Proposal Approval Flow (COMPLETE)
**Time:** ~1 hour  
**Lines of Code:** ~400

**What Was Built:**
- Human-in-the-loop approval process
- `CONTEXTPILOT_AUTO_APPROVE_PROPOSALS` flag
- Proposal persistence (JSON + Markdown)
- Extension integration with auto-refresh

**Key Features:**
- Proposals require user approval before commit
- Flag controls auto-commit behavior
- Extension shows context-aware messages
- Git Agent only commits when approved

**Commits:**
- `8436ba9` - feat(proposals): implement human-in-the-loop approval flow

---

### 4. 🚧 Proposal Diffs + AI Review (IN PROGRESS)
**Time:** ~30 minutes  
**Lines of Code:** ~400

**What Was Built:**
- Enhanced Proposal models with diff support
- Diff generator utilities
- Before/after content structure
- AI review integration structure

**Next Steps:**
- Update Spec Agent to generate diffs
- Build extension diff viewer
- Integrate with Cursor Chat
- Test end-to-end flow

**Commits:**
- `96b7a3a` - feat(proposals): add diff support for AI-assisted review

## 🎨 Key Design Decisions

### 1. Event-Driven Architecture
**Decision:** Use Pub/Sub for agent communication  
**Rationale:**
- Decouples agents completely
- Scalable across Cloud Run instances
- Observable and debuggable
- Easy to add new agents

**Trade-offs:**
- Slightly more complex than direct calls
- Requires GCP setup for production
- Event ordering considerations

**Mitigation:**
- In-memory mode for development
- Clear event schemas
- Comprehensive logging

---

### 2. Custom Artifacts with Natural Language Rules
**Decision:** Let users define agent behavior via YAML + prompts  
**Rationale:**
- No code changes needed
- Flexible per-project customization
- Version controlled
- Easy to understand

**Trade-offs:**
- Rules must be well-written
- No compile-time validation
- LLM must interpret correctly

**Mitigation:**
- Template library with examples
- Rule validation (future)
- Clear documentation

---

### 3. Proposals with Diffs
**Decision:** Include actual code changes in proposals  
**Rationale:**
- Users need to see what will change
- Enables AI-assisted review
- Builds trust in agent suggestions
- Supports informed decisions

**Trade-offs:**
- Larger proposal payloads
- Diff generation complexity
- Patch application edge cases

**Mitigation:**
- Efficient diff format (unified)
- Robust diff generator
- Fallback to manual merge

---

## 🔍 Critical Insight: AI-Assisted Review

**Problem Identified:**
Users in Cursor want to ask Claude: "Are these changes good?" before approving agent proposals.

**Current Gap:**
- ❌ Proposals only have metadata
- ❌ No actual code changes visible
- ❌ No integration with Cursor's AI

**Solution:**
1. Proposals include full diffs
2. Extension shows diff viewer
3. "Ask Claude" button opens Cursor Chat
4. Claude analyzes diff and advises
5. User makes informed decision

**Impact:**
- Builds trust in AI agents
- Leverages user's preferred AI (Claude, GPT, etc.)
- Combines cloud agents + local AI
- Educational for users
